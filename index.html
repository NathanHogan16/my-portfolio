            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. I bet you thought this who thing was filler text. To start 
                off I like to have fun and enjoy myself in a professional environment.
                I think it is very important to enjoy your job and when you do that you will want to work hard.
                I am a very hard working and loyal person and that will show if you get to know me. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A little about my personal life is that I am married to a wonderful wife and couln't be happier.
                I like to play soccer and hang out with friends and family. When playing for my highschool soccer
                team I received the most dedicated player award because it was fun to me.  I also enjoy coding and
                will most definately put forth the same effort towards that as I did in soccer.
